#//TODO List for future workshops:

* Add code formatting to the printed handouts
    * Explanation of common terms: `#DEFINE`, `#IFDEF`, `if()`, `for()`
    * Explanation of common operators: 
    	* =
    	* ==
    	* </=
    	* >=
* See about simplifing PID.c
	* A neat topic to talk about, but honesty impossible to cover with the current formatting
* Is trimming functional? Looks like it may write values to an array and then just _die_.
* See if I can't get telemetry working on any device.
